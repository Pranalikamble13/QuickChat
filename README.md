Developed a web-based chatbot that interacts with users to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) using keyword matching and simple AI logic. The chatbot helps users get instant answers related to a company’s products, services, or general queries.

*** Key Features ***
User-friendly chat interface

Predefined answers based on keyword matching

Fallback to generic response if query is unknown

Simple Natural Language Understanding logic

Responsive design for mobile and desktop

 Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend (Optional): Node.js (if making it dynamic)

No API required — uses local script logic

 *** How It Works ***
User types a question

The chatbot compares the input with predefined keywords

If matched, it gives a relevant response

If no match, it says "I'm sorry, I don't have an answer for that yet."
